<h1>Terms of Use for TipsyPal</h1>
<p><strong>Version 2.1 — Last Updated: 2025-12-16<br>
Governing Entity: OakDev &amp; AI AB (Sweden)</strong></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the TipsyPal mobile application (“TipsyPal”, “App”,
“Service”), operated and owned by OakDev &amp; AI AB, a Swedish limited liability company (“we”, “us”, “our”).
</p>
<p>
By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use
the App.
</p>
<p>
These Terms apply to all users of the Service, whether registered or unregistered.
</p>

<h2>2. About TipsyPal</h2>
<p>
TipsyPal is an AI-assisted writing and communication enhancement tool designed to help users produce clearer, more polished,
and more effective text.
</p>
<p>Core features include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>AI-generated rewriting, tone adjustment, and enhancement</li>
  <li>Grammar and clarity improvements</li>
  <li>Message drafting for social media, messaging apps, and personal communication</li>
  <li>Multiple language support</li>
  <li>Optional AI persona modes</li>
  <li>Credit-based entitlements and optional premium access</li>
</ul>
<p>TipsyPal is not intended to replace professional advice of any kind.</p>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least 13 years old, and</li>
  <li>Legally permitted to use the App under the laws of your jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are under 18, you may use the App only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate eligibility requirements.</p>

<h2>4. Account Registration</h2>
<p>
Certain features require creating an account using Firebase Authentication. You agree to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide accurate and complete information</li>
  <li>Maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
  <li>Accept responsibility for all activity occurring under your account</li>
</ul>
<p>
We are not liable for unauthorized access resulting from your failure to secure your credentials.
</p>

<h2>5. Basic &amp; Champion Access (Credits Model)</h2>

<h3>5.1. Basic (One-Time Purchase)</h3>
<p>
Purchasing Basic unlocks access to a fixed allocation of AI credits (for example, <strong>200 credits</strong>).
Credits are consumed when you use AI generation features (e.g., prompt-based output generation).
</p>

<h3>5.2. Champion (Credit Pack / Premium Entitlement)</h3>
<p>
Champion is offered as a premium access option that provides a larger allocation of AI credits (for example,
<strong>2,000 credits</strong>) and may include premium features such as enhanced modes, priority access to new features, or
additional functionality as described in the App at the time of purchase.
</p>
<p>
Champion may be offered as a one-time entitlement and/or as a store-managed product, and is governed by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Play Billing</li>
  <li>Apple App Store Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your purchases are processed by your app store provider, not OakDev &amp; AI AB. Pricing, availability, taxes, refunds,
and cancellations are determined by the applicable app store policies and local law.
</p>

<h3>5.3. Top-Ups / Additional Credits</h3>
<p>
You may be able to purchase additional AI credits (“Top-Ups”) such as credit packs. Top-Ups add credits to your balance and
are consumed as you use AI features. The exact packs, prices, and amounts are shown in the App store listing and in the App.
</p>

<h3>5.4. No Guarantee of Specific Allocation or Availability</h3>
<p>
We may adjust credit amounts, pack configurations, and feature availability over time. Any changes will be reflected in the
App and/or store listing. Where required by law, material changes will be communicated to you.
</p>
